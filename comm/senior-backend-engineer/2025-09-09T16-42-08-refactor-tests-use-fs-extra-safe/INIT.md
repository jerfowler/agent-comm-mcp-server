# Task: Refactor All Test Files to Use fs-extra-safe Instead of fs-extra

## Context
We have been repeatedly encountering TypeScript strict mode violations in test files due to fs-extra mocking patterns. The root cause is that we're using fs-extra directly instead of the existing `fs-extra-safe.ts` utility that was designed to solve these exact problems.

## Current Issues
1. **ServerResourceProvider.test.ts** - TypeScript errors with fs-extra mocking
2. **Multiple test files** - Likely have similar fs-extra direct usage issues
3. **PR #30** - CI failures due to these TypeScript violations

## Required Actions

### 1. Audit All Test Files
- Find all test files using fs-extra directly
- Identify the specific mocking patterns causing TypeScript errors
- Document which files need refactoring

### 2. Refactor to fs-extra-safe
- Replace all direct fs-extra imports with fs-extra-safe imports
- Update mocking patterns to work with fs-extra-safe
- Ensure all TypeScript strict mode requirements are met

### 3. Fix Immediate Issues
- Fix `tests/unit/resources/providers/ServerResourceProvider.test.ts`
- Fix any other test files with similar patterns
- Ensure all tests pass TypeScript compilation

### 4. Verify Solution
- Run `npm run type-check` to verify no TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run test` to ensure all tests pass
- Confirm 95%+ test coverage is maintained

## Architecture Insight
The `src/utils/fs-extra-safe.ts` utility already handles:
- Proper TypeScript typing for fs-extra operations
- Fallback mechanisms for fs-extra import issues
- Safe mocking patterns that work with strict mode

## Success Criteria
- Zero TypeScript strict mode violations in all test files
- All tests passing with proper fs-extra-safe usage
- PR #30 CI pipeline passing
- Maintainable test patterns that won't cause future fs-extra issues

## Priority
HIGH - This is blocking PR merges and causing repeated development friction

## MCP Task Management Protocol

### IMPORTANT: Creating Tasks
**ALWAYS** use `create_task` for ANY new task:
```javascript
create_task({
  agent: "target-agent",      // Required: target agent name
  taskName: "task-name",      // Required: clean name (NO timestamps)
  content: "task details",    // Optional: include for delegation
  taskType: "delegation",     // Optional: delegation|self|subtask
  parentTask: "parent-id"     // Optional: for subtasks only
})
```

### CRITICAL: Task Workflow
**YOU MUST** follow this exact sequence:
1. `check_assigned_tasks()` - **ALWAYS** start here
2. `start_task(taskId)` - **REQUIRED** before any work
3. `submit_plan(content)` - **MANDATORY** before implementation
4. `report_progress(updates)` - **UPDATE** after each step
5. `mark_complete(status, summary, reconciliation_options)` - **ONLY** when fully done

### MANDATORY: Todo Integration
**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
- **CREATE** TodoWrite items for EVERY task step
- **UPDATE** todos to 'in_progress' BEFORE starting work
- **MARK** todos 'completed' IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- **NEVER** have more than ONE 'in_progress' item
- **INCLUDE** MCP operations as todo items

### REQUIRED Plan Format
**ALL PLANS MUST USE CHECKBOX FORMAT:**

Each trackable item MUST follow this structure:
```
- [ ] **Step Title**: Brief one-line description
  - Action: Specific command or task
  - Expected: Success criteria
  - Error: Handling approach if fails
  - Notes: Additional context (optional)
```

**Example Plan Format:**
```markdown
## Testing Plan

- [ ] **Test Discovery**: Identify all test configurations
  - Run: `pnpm list --filter "*" --depth 0`
  - Scan for: jest.config.*, *.test.ts, *.spec.ts files
  - Expected: List of all test files and configurations
  - Error handling: If no tests found, document as critical issue
  - Dependencies: Node.js and pnpm installed

- [ ] **Test Execution**: Run all test suites
  - Command: `pnpm test:all --coverage`
  - Success criteria: All tests pass with >80% coverage
  - Failure action: Document failed tests with error messages
  - Output location: ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

**VALIDATION RULES:**
- Minimum ONE checkbox required (use `- [ ]` format exactly)
- Each checkbox must have bold title: `**Title**:`
- Each checkbox must have 2-5 detail bullets
- NO [PENDING]/[COMPLETE] status markers allowed
- Use ONLY checkboxes for tracking

### CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE
- **NEVER** create duplicate tasks (auto-prevented)
- **NEVER** add timestamps to taskName
- **ALWAYS** update progress after EACH action
- **ALWAYS** sync todos with actual work
- **NEVER** skip submit_plan step
- **ONLY** mark complete when 100% done
- **ALWAYS** use checkbox format in plans
- **UNDERSTAND** reconciliation modes for mark_complete

### Task Completion Reconciliation
**mark_complete** supports intelligent reconciliation when plan checkboxes remain unchecked:

**4 Reconciliation Modes:**
1. **`strict`** (default) - Requires ALL checkboxes checked before DONE status
   - Use when: Plan adherence is critical
   - Behavior: Rejects DONE with unchecked items, allows ERROR

2. **`auto_complete`** - Automatically marks unchecked items complete
   - Use when: Work is done but forgot to check boxes
   - Behavior: Updates PLAN.md with all items checked

3. **`reconcile`** - Accept completion with explanations for variances  
   - Use when: Completed work differently than planned
   - Requires: reconciliation_explanations object
   - Behavior: Creates variance report with justifications

4. **`force`** - Override completion despite unchecked items
   - Use when: Emergency completion, plan became obsolete
   - Behavior: Documents forced override with warnings

**Reconciliation Examples (Essential Examples for Proper Usage):**
```javascript
// Example 1: Default strict mode (recommended example)
mark_complete({
  status: 'DONE',
  summary: 'All work completed as planned',
  agent: 'agent-name'
  // No reconciliation = strict mode
});

// Example 3: Auto-complete forgotten checkboxes example
mark_complete({
  status: 'DONE', 
  summary: 'Forgot to check boxes during work',
  agent: 'agent-name',
  reconciliation_mode: 'auto_complete'
});

// Example 4: Reconcile with explanations (detailed example)
mark_complete({
  status: 'DONE',
  summary: 'Core work done, some items handled differently', 
  agent: 'agent-name',
  reconciliation_mode: 'reconcile',
  reconciliation_explanations: {
    'Database Setup': 'Used existing schema, setup not needed',
    'Performance Testing': 'Deferred to next sprint per stakeholder decision'
  }
});

// Force completion in emergency  
mark_complete({
  status: 'DONE',
  summary: 'Emergency deployment, remaining items moved to backlog',
  agent: 'agent-name', 
  reconciliation_mode: 'force'
});
```

**BEST PRACTICES:**
- **Update checkboxes** as you complete work (prevents reconciliation need)
- **Use strict mode** by default (ensures plan accountability) 
- **Provide clear explanations** when using reconcile mode
- **Reserve force mode** for genuine emergencies only
- **Document reconciliation decisions** thoroughly in summary

### Diagnostic Tools
- `track_task_progress(agent, taskId)` - Monitor progress
- `get_full_lifecycle(agent, taskId)` - View task history

**REMEMBER:** Update todos, use checkbox format in plans, and report progress CONTINUOUSLY!
