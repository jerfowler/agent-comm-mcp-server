## Fix PR #30 CI Failures and Create New PR Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigate PR #30 CI Failures

- [x] **Fetch and Switch to PR Branch**: Checkout PR #30 branch to investigate failures
  - Action: Run `git fetch origin && git checkout feature/filesystem-utilities-cleanup`
  - Expected: Successfully switch to PR branch
  - Error: If branch missing, fetch directly from PR
  - Notes: Need to analyze current state of failing branch

- [x] **Check PR #30 CI Status**: Review GitHub Actions failure details
  - Action: Use `gh pr checks 30` to see CI status
  - Expected: Identify specific failing tests in MCP Protocol Integration
  - Error: If gh fails, check via GitHub web interface
  - Notes: Document specific test failures for resolution

- [x] **Run Local Tests on PR Branch**: Execute CI pipeline locally to reproduce failures
  - Action: Run `npm run ci && npm test`
  - Expected: Reproduce CI failures locally for debugging
  - Error: Document any environment-specific issues
  - Notes: Compare with recent feature branch test results

### Phase 2: Merge Recent Fixes into PR #30

- [x] **Merge Feature Branch into PR**: Apply MCP Resources System fixes to PR branch
  - Action: Run `git merge feature/mcp-2025-06-18-compliance`
  - Expected: Successful merge with minimal conflicts
  - Error: Resolve conflicts favoring feature branch changes
  - Notes: Ensure all MCP Resources System components included

- [x] **Resolve Merge Conflicts**: Handle any conflicts from merge
  - Action: Review and resolve conflicts in modified files
  - Expected: Clean resolution maintaining both sets of improvements
  - Error: Document complex conflicts for review
  - Notes: Prioritize TypeScript strict mode compliance

- [x] **Verify Tests Pass**: Run full test suite after merge
  - Action: Run `npm run ci && npm test && npm run test:integration`
  - Expected: All 926 tests pass with 95%+ coverage
  - Error: Debug any remaining failures
  - Notes: Ensure MCP Protocol Integration tests now pass

- [x] **Push Updated PR Branch**: Update PR with fixes
  - Action: Run `git push origin feature/filesystem-utilities-cleanup`
  - Expected: CI pipeline triggers and passes
  - Error: Force push if needed with `--force-with-lease`
  - Notes: Monitor GitHub Actions for successful CI run

### Phase 3: Create New PR for MCP Resources System

- [x] **Prepare Feature Branch**: Ensure feature branch is ready for PR
  - Action: Run `git checkout feature/mcp-2025-06-18-compliance && git status`
  - Expected: Clean working directory with all changes committed
  - Error: Commit any uncommitted changes
  - Notes: Verify all MCP Resources System files included

- [x] **Push Feature Branch**: Push branch to origin
  - Action: Run `git push -u origin feature/mcp-2025-06-18-compliance`
  - Expected: Branch pushed successfully
  - Error: Resolve any push conflicts
  - Notes: Ensure branch is up to date with main

- [x] **Create Pull Request**: Open PR for MCP Resources System
  - Action: Use `gh pr create` with proper title and description
  - Expected: PR created linking to issue #29
  - Error: Create via GitHub web if gh fails
  - Notes: Include comprehensive PR description with achievements

- [ ] **Verify Both PRs Pass CI**: Confirm all CI checks green
  - Action: Monitor both PR #30 and new PR CI status
  - Expected: All checks pass for both PRs
  - Error: Debug and fix any remaining issues
  - Notes: Document successful resolution in task completion

### Success Criteria
- PR #30 CI failures resolved with all checks passing
- New PR created for MCP Resources System implementation
- All 926 tests passing with 95%+ coverage
- TypeScript strict mode compilation successful
- Both PRs ready for review and merge
