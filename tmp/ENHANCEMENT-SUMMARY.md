## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Hook Integration Architecture
```
TodoWrite Tool â†’ Hook Execution â†’ MCP Server Integration
     â†“                â†“                     â†“
Todos Updated â†’ Analysis & Reminder â†’ sync_todo_checkboxes()
```

### Key Features Implemented
- **Non-disruptive integration**: Hook uses exit code 2 for success with info
- **Intelligent filtering**: Only shows reminders when sync is actually needed
- **Three-state checkbox mapping**: `[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]` for pending/in-progress/completed
- **Fuzzy matching**: 60% similarity threshold for checkbox title matching
- **Lock coordination**: Prevents conflicts with concurrent MCP operations

### Documentation Organization
- **README.md**: User-friendly, conversational setup (3 steps)
- **PROTOCOL.md**: Technical deep-dive with advanced configuration
- **Verification Script**: Automated testing and validation

## ðŸ“– User Experience Improvements
