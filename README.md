## What This Does

Think of this as a **mission control** for AI agents. Instead of trying to do everything yourself, you can delegate specific tasks to specialized agents (like a frontend engineer, backend engineer, or QA tester) and monitor their complete thought process from start to finish.

### Why You'd Want This

**üéØ **Delegation Made Simple**: Create tasks for specific agents without worrying about file management or coordination complexity**

**üîç **Complete Transparency**: See exactly how each agent understood your request, planned their approach, and executed the work**

**üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track progress without interrupting agents or blocking your workflow**

**üõ°Ô∏è **Zero Complexity**: Agents get clean task context automatically‚Äîno file paths, no setup headaches**

**üîÑ **Smart Completion**: Flexible task completion that handles real-world variations from the original plan**

**‚ö° **Non-Blocking**: All agents can work simultaneously while you stay productive**

### New Features (v0.9.0)

**üîç **Zero-Trust Verification** (Issue #49)**: Advanced accountability system with red flag detection prevents agent deception through evidence-based verification

**üìä **Enhanced Error Logging** (Issue #50)**: Comprehensive error tracking with ErrorLogger class, pattern analysis, and agent error rate monitoring

**üêõ **Debug Integration** (Issue #50)**: Full debug package integration across 49 source files with namespace hierarchy for granular debugging control

**üö¶ **Parallel Execution Support** (Issue #49)**: Multi-agent coordination with concurrent tool calls and automatic evidence tracking

## Quick Start

### Installation

Choose the method that works best for your setup:

```bash
# Option 1: Global installation (recommended for MCP)
npm install -g @jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server

# Option 2: Use directly without installation
npx @jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server

# Option 3: From source
git clone https://github.com/jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server.git
cd agent-comm-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
```

### Setup with Claude

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Install and setup in one step
npm install -g @jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server
npm run setup  # Creates .mcp.json with all configured servers
```

**Manual Setup:**
Add this to your Claude configuration file (`.mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-comm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_COMM_DIR": "./comm"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**üîí Security Note:** Never commit API keys to git. The `.mcp.json` file is gitignored to protect sensitive credentials. Use `.mcp.json.example` as a template and `npm run setup` for easy configuration.

### Optional: TodoWrite Hook Integration

Want your Claude Code todos to automatically sync with agent task checkboxes? This optional hook makes it seamless.

**What it does:** When you update todos with TodoWrite, the hook reminds you to sync those changes to your active agent task's PLAN.md checkboxes. No more manual checkbox updates!

**Quick Setup (3 steps):**

1. **Copy the hook file** to your Claude Code hooks directory:
```bash
# The hook is already in your agent-comm-mcp-server installation
cp node_modules/@jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server/.claude/hooks/sync-todos-to-checkboxes.py ~/.claude/hooks/
```

2. **Make it executable:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/sync-todos-to-checkboxes.py
```

3. **Test it works:**
```bash
echo '{"tool":{"name":"TodoWrite"},"result":{"todos":[{"content":"Test todo","status":"completed","activeForm":"Testing"}]}}' | python3 ~/.claude/hooks/sync-todos-to-checkboxes.py
# Should output: "TodoWrite updated 1 todo: 1 completed, 0 in-progress, 0 pending"
# Remember to sync to your task checkboxes using the agent-comm MCP if you have an active task
```

**Need help?** Run our verification script to check everything:
```bash
# Download and run the verification script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerfowler/agent-comm-mcp-server/main/scripts/verify-hook-installation.sh | bash

# Or if you have the project locally
./scripts/verify-hook-installation.sh
```

**That's it!** Now when you use TodoWrite, you'll get helpful reminders to sync your todo changes to agent task checkboxes using the `sync_todo_checkboxes` tool.

**Skip this if:** You don't use TodoWrite or prefer manual checkbox management. The agent communication works perfectly without this hook.

### Try It Out

Here are some conversational prompts you can use with Claude right away:

**Delegate a task:**
```
Using the agent-comm tools, create a task for senior-frontend-engineer to implement a responsive dashboard with dark mode support and real-time updates. Include proper TypeScript interfaces.
```

**Check on progress:**
```
Can you use the agent-comm server to check how the dashboard task is going for the frontend engineer?
```

**Get the full story:**
```
Use agent-comm tools to show me the complete lifecycle of that dashboard task - what did the agent understand, how did they plan it, and what was the final result?
```

**Clean up when done:**
```
Please use the agent-comm server to archive all completed tasks.
```

## How It Works

### The Agent Task Lifecycle

Every task goes through a clear, trackable lifecycle:

```
1. INIT: What you asked for ‚Üí 2. PLAN: How they'll do it ‚Üí 3. PROGRESS: Work updates ‚Üí 4. DONE/ERROR: Final result
```

This gives you complete visibility into:
- **What the agent understood** from your request
- **How they planned** to approach the work  
- **What they actually did** step by step
- **What the final outcome** was (success or failure)

### Two Ways to Work

**Context-Based (Recommended - Simple):**
Agents get clean task descriptions automatically. You never deal with file paths or technical details. Just create tasks and monitor progress.

**Traditional (Advanced - Full Control):**
Direct access to all task files and management. Perfect if you need granular control over the process.

### How the Smart Response System Works (NEW)

The **Smart Response System** learns from your agent interactions to provide progressively better guidance over time. It automatically detects common patterns and helps agents complete tasks more effectively.

**What it does for you:**

1. **Detects Incomplete Delegations**: When you create a task for another agent, the system notices if you forget to follow up and provides the exact command to check on it.

2. **Progressive Guidance**: As agents work together more, the system learns their patterns and provides increasingly specific help:
   - **New agents** get friendly reminders about the workflow
   - **Experienced agents** get concise, targeted guidance
   - **Struggling agents** receive more detailed assistance

3. **Automatic Compliance Tracking**: The system quietly tracks how well agents follow the task workflow and adjusts its guidance accordingly‚Äîno manual intervention needed.

4. **Parallel Execution Optimization**: Automatically detects opportunities to run multiple agents in parallel and generates the specific Task() commands for you. The parallel execution feature analyzes task dependencies and suggests concurrent execution patterns to maximize throughput.

5. **Escalating Urgency Levels**: Provides gentle reminders for compliant agents, firm warnings for those falling behind, and critical alerts when immediate action is required.

**Example: Before and After**

**Before Smart Response System:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "taskId": "2025-01-10T10-30-00-implement-feature",
  "message": "Task created successfully"
}
```

**After Smart Response System:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "taskId": "2025-01-10T10-30-00-implement-feature",
  "message": "Task created successfully",
  "guidance": {
    "next_steps": "You've delegated to frontend-engineer. Check their progress with:",
    "actionable_command": "mcp__agent_comm__track_task_progress(agent=\"frontend-engineer\", taskId=\"2025-01-10T10-30-00-implement-feature\")",
    "contextual_reminder": "Remember to review their plan before they start implementation",
    "compliance_level": 85
  }
}
```

**Parallel Execution Example:**

When the system detects multiple independent tasks, it automatically suggests parallel execution patterns. This parallel execution capability dramatically reduces overall completion time by utilizing all available agents concurrently.

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "task-1", "targetAgent": "senior-frontend-engineer" },
    { "id": "task-2", "targetAgent": "senior-backend-engineer" },
    { "id": "task-3", "targetAgent": "senior-dba-advisor" }
  ],
  "guidance": {
    "contextual_reminder": "üöÄ PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITY: Multiple independent tasks detected!",
    "actionable_command": "# Execute these agents in parallel:\nTask(subagent_type=\"senior-frontend-engineer\", prompt=\"Handle task: task-1\")\nTask(subagent_type=\"senior-backend-engineer\", prompt=\"Handle task: task-2\")\nTask(subagent_type=\"senior-dba-advisor\", prompt=\"Handle task: task-3\")"
  }
}
```

The parallel execution optimizer considers task dependencies, agent availability, and workload distribution to generate optimal execution strategies.

The system is **completely automatic**‚Äîit's enabled by default and works silently in the background. You'll only notice it when it helps you avoid mistakes or complete tasks more efficiently.

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Parallel Development Team
```
Create these tasks in parallel using agent-comm tools:
1. senior-backend-engineer: "Design REST API for user authentication"
2. senior-frontend-engineer: "Build login/signup UI components"  
3. qa-test-automation-engineer: "Create test suite for auth system"
4. devops-deployment-engineer: "Set up staging environment"
```

### Large Feature Implementation
```
Use agent-comm to delegate this complex e-commerce cart implementation to senior-frontend-engineer: "Build shopping cart with real-time inventory updates, discount code support, saved cart persistence, and mobile-responsive checkout flow."

Then monitor progress and get diagnostic insights on their approach.
```

### Code Review and Quality
```
After the frontend work is complete, use agent-comm to assign qa-test-automation-engineer: "Review the shopping cart implementation and create comprehensive automated tests covering all user flows and edge cases."
```

## Why This Architecture

**Non-Blocking by Design**: You can launch multiple agents and they'll work simultaneously while you stay productive. No waiting around for sequential completion.

**Complete Transparency**: Instead of wondering "what is that agent doing?", you get full insight into their thinking process, planning, and execution.

**File System Abstraction**: Agents never see file paths or directory structures. They get clean task context and produce clean results. No more path-related bugs or setup complexity.

**Real-World Flexibility**: The reconciliation system handles when agents find better approaches or encounter unexpected issues. Tasks can still complete successfully even when the original plan changes.

**Production Ready**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive testing, error handling, and logging. Built for reliability in real development workflows.

---

## Environment Options

The server is configurable via environment variables:

| Variable | What It Does | Default |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `AGENT_COMM_DIR` | Where to store task communications | `./comm` |
| `AGENT_COMM_ARCHIVE_DIR` | Where to store completed tasks | `./comm/.archive` |
| `AGENT_COMM_LOG_DIR` | Where to store operation logs | `./comm/.logs` |
| `AGENT_COMM_DISABLE_ARCHIVE` | Turn off archiving completely | `false` |

For most users, the defaults work perfectly. The system creates directories automatically as needed.

---

## Filesystem Architecture

The server implements a **robust dual-layer filesystem architecture** designed for reliable file operations with comprehensive error handling and cross-platform compatibility.

### Architecture Overview

```
High-Level Operations (file-system.ts)
    ‚Üì Validation & Error Handling
Low-Level Operations (fs-extra-safe.ts)  
    ‚Üì Fallback Mechanisms
Node.js Built-in Modules (fs, path)
    ‚Üì Cross-Platform Support
Operating System Filesystem
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**üéØ High-Level Layer (`src/utils/file-system.ts`)**
- Task-focused operations with domain validation
- Automatic directory creation for write operations
- Meaningful error messages with context (FileNotFoundError, InvalidTaskError)
- Task metadata parsing and validation utilities
- Agent Communication Server specific functionality

**‚öôÔ∏è Low-Level Layer (`src/utils/fs-extra-safe.ts`)**
- Direct filesystem operations with Node.js built-in fallbacks  
- Handles fs-extra import issues and module resolution conflicts
- Diagnostic capabilities and performance monitoring
- Cross-platform reliability with multiple import strategies
- Basic operations: pathExists, readdir, writeFile, readFile, stat, remove, ensureDir

### Usage Guidelines

**Use High-Level Layer when:**
- Creating or managing agent tasks
- Need validation (task names, agent names)
- Want automatic directory creation
- Need domain-specific error handling

**Use Low-Level Layer when:**
- Need direct filesystem control
- Bulk operations like directory scanning
- Require specific fs-extra features
- Building custom filesystem utilities

### Key Benefits

**üõ°Ô∏è Reliability**: Multi-strategy imports with Node.js fallbacks ensure operations work regardless of fs-extra installation status

**üîí Validation**: Comprehensive input validation prevents path traversal attacks and invalid task creation

**üöÄ Performance**: Optimized imports and caching reduce overhead while maintaining flexibility

**üîß Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and extend

**üåê Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments

This architecture ensures reliable filesystem operations while providing the flexibility needed for both simple task management and complex agent coordination workflows.
