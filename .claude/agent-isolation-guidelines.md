# Agent Process Isolation Guidelines

This document defines process isolation requirements to prevent validation system bypasses like the one that occurred in PR #34.

## Critical Isolation Requirements

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Isolation
**Problem**: Backend engineers bypassed 'any' type validation hooks that worked locally
**Solution**: Multi-layer validation with server-side enforcement

#### Local Hook Validation
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit must be executable and comprehensive
#!/bin/bash
# CRITICAL: Never allow bypassing with --no-verify without explicit approval

# Phase 1: TypeScript strict mode validation
if ! npm run type-check; then
    echo "‚ùå TypeScript strict mode validation failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Phase 2: 'any' type detection in staged files
ANY_COUNT=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.ts$' | xargs grep -l "\bany\b" | wc -l)
if [ "$ANY_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå 'any' types detected in staged files"
    echo "Use specific types or 'unknown' instead"
    exit 1
fi

# Phase 3: ESLint strict enforcement
if ! npm run lint; then
    echo "‚ùå ESLint validation failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Server-side Validation (GitHub Actions)
- **Required status checks** cannot be bypassed
- **Branch protection** enforces validation for all users including admins
- **PR size validation** prevents massive changes that hide violations

### 2. Agent Work Environment Isolation

#### Backend Engineer Constraints
```yaml
# .claude/agent-constraints/senior-backend-engineer.yml
constraints:
  pre_work_validation:
    - "Review TEST-ERROR-PATTERNS.md for banned patterns"
    - "Confirm TypeScript strict mode requirements understood"
    - "Verify no 'any' types will be introduced"
    
  prohibited_actions:
    - "Bypass pre-commit hooks with --no-verify"
    - "Disable TypeScript strict mode checks"
    - "Add 'any' types to production code"
    - "Skip ESLint validation"
    
  required_verification:
    - "npm run type-check before any commit"
    - "npm run lint before any commit"
    - "npm run test:smoke for critical changes"
    
  escalation_triggers:
    - "Any 'any' type addition requires architecture review"
    - "TypeScript strict mode violations require senior review"
    - "Test failures require QA engineer consultation"
```

#### QA Engineer Validation Authority
```yaml
# .claude/agent-constraints/qa-test-automation-engineer.yml
authority:
  validation_override:
    - "Can reject PRs with insufficient test coverage"
    - "Can block merges with failing quality gates"
    - "Can require additional testing for large changes"
    
  quality_enforcement:
    - "Minimum 95% test coverage on new code"
    - "Zero TypeScript strict mode violations"
    - "Comprehensive test error pattern prevention"
    
  review_requirements:
    - "Must approve all PRs affecting test infrastructure"
    - "Must validate all test pattern changes"
    - "Must sign off on quality gate modifications"
```

### 3. Process Isolation Architecture

#### Validation Chain of Command
```
Developer ‚Üí Pre-commit Hooks ‚Üí PR Creation ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí Branch Protection ‚Üí QA Review ‚Üí Merge
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì              ‚Üì                ‚Üì             ‚Üì        ‚Üì
  Local Check ‚Üí Git Hooks ‚Üí PR Size Check ‚Üí CI Pipeline ‚Üí Status Checks ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Archive
```

#### Failure Isolation Points
1. **Local Development**: Pre-commit hooks catch violations immediately
2. **PR Creation**: Size validation prevents massive changes
3. **CI Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing validates all changes
4. **Branch Protection**: Required status checks cannot be bypassed
5. **Code Review**: Human validation for business logic and architecture
6. **Post-merge**: Archive cleanup and monitoring

### 4. Communication Protocol Isolation

#### Task Delegation Boundaries
```typescript
// Agent communication must follow isolation protocol
interface AgentIsolationProtocol {
  validation_authority: {
    backend_engineer: ['implementation', 'business_logic'];
    qa_engineer: ['testing', 'quality_gates', 'validation_rules'];
    security_analyst: ['vulnerability_assessment', 'compliance_review'];
  };
  
  escalation_paths: {
    type_violations: 'qa_engineer';
    test_failures: 'qa_engineer';
    security_issues: 'security_analyst';
    architecture_changes: 'senior_system_architect';
  };
  
  bypass_prevention: {
    no_self_approval: true;
    required_status_checks: true;
    branch_protection_enforced: true;
    admin_override_logged: true;
  };
}
```

#### MCP Agent Communication Isolation
```bash
# Agent task creation with validation requirements
mcp__agent_comm__create_task({
  agent: "senior-backend-engineer",
  taskName: "fix-typescript-violations",
  content: `
## Validation Requirements
- [ ] Zero 'any' types in solution
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] ESLint validation passing
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at 95%+

## Isolation Protocol
- This task requires QA engineer validation before completion
- No pre-commit hook bypassing allowed
- All changes must pass CI pipeline before submission
  `,
  taskType: "delegation"
});
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Automated Prevention
```bash
# .claude/hooks/validation-enforcer.py
def enforce_agent_isolation(tool_use, agent_context):
    """Prevent agents from bypassing validation systems"""
    
    if tool_use.tool == "Bash" and "--no-verify" in tool_use.command:
        if agent_context.agent_type == "senior-backend-engineer":
            return {
                "allow": False,
                "message": "Backend engineers cannot bypass pre-commit validation",
                "alternative": "Use 'npm run ci' to validate before commit"
            }
    
    if tool_use.tool == "Edit" and "any" in tool_use.new_string:
        return {
            "allow": False, 
            "message": "'any' types are prohibited in TypeScript files",
            "alternative": "Use specific types or 'unknown' instead"
        }
    
    return {"allow": True}
```

### 2. Process Monitoring
```bash
# .github/workflows/process-isolation-monitor.yml
name: Process Isolation Monitor

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main, test]

jobs:
  isolation-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for validation bypasses
        run: |
          # Monitor for common bypass attempts
          if git log --oneline -10 | grep -i "skip.*ci\|no.*verify\|bypass"; then
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Potential validation bypass detected"
          fi
          
          # Check for admin overrides
          if git log --format="%an %s" -10 | grep -i "admin\|override\|force"; then
            echo "üîç Admin override detected - logging for audit"
          fi
```

### 3. Agent Education System
```typescript
// .claude/agent-education/validation-requirements.ts
export const VALIDATION_EDUCATION = {
  backend_engineer: {
    before_work: [
      "Review current TypeScript strict mode requirements",
      "Check TEST-ERROR-PATTERNS.md for prohibited patterns", 
      "Understand 'any' type ban and alternatives",
      "Verify test coverage requirements (95%+)"
    ],
    
    during_work: [
      "Run 'npm run type-check' frequently during development",
      "Use ESLint integration in IDE for real-time feedback",
      "Write tests before implementing features (TDD)",
      "Validate changes with 'npm run ci' before commit"
    ],
    
    after_work: [
      "Confirm all validation passes locally",
      "Ensure PR size is reasonable (< 5,000 changes)",
      "Request QA review for test infrastructure changes",
      "Monitor CI pipeline for any failures"
    ]
  },
  
  escalation_education: {
    when_to_escalate: [
      "TypeScript strict mode violations cannot be resolved",
      "Test coverage drops below 95% threshold",
      "ESLint rules conflict with business requirements",
      "Architecture changes affect multiple domains"
    ],
    
    how_to_escalate: [
      "Use MCP agent communication for task delegation",
      "Include full context and error messages",
      "Specify validation requirements clearly",
      "Follow up with progress tracking tools"
    ]
  }
};
```

## Implementation Verification

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent 'any' type additions
- [ ] GitHub Actions enforce comprehensive validation
- [ ] Branch protection requires all status checks
- [ ] PR size validation prevents massive changes
- [ ] Agent constraints prevent validation bypassing
- [ ] Communication protocol enforces isolation boundaries
- [ ] Education system prevents accidental violations
- [ ] Monitoring detects bypass attempts

### Testing Isolation Effectiveness
```bash
# Test pre-commit hook isolation
echo "const test: any = 'violation';" > test-violation.ts
git add test-violation.ts
git commit -m "test: validation isolation" # Should fail

# Test GitHub Actions isolation
# Create PR with 'any' types - should be blocked by CI

# Test agent communication isolation
# Attempt to bypass validation through MCP tools - should be prevented
```

This isolation system ensures that validation failures like PR #34 cannot recur by implementing defense in depth across multiple layers of the development process.
